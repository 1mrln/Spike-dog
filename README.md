# Spike-dog
Robotic dog with social functions made with Lego Spike.

## What is this? 
We build a robotic dog with a focus on social interaction. It can move freely around the room and avoids obstacles. It also shows different reactions to different colors. When it sees yellow, it "greets" you by wagging its head and tail and barking happily. On magenta, it stops, barks and sounds the alarm. At the touch of a button, it starts the "heel" function, in which it moves at a defined distance from a person/object. 
In the following you can see a video with the functions and the code will be explained later.

## Ursprüngliche Idee & Weiterentwicklung
At the beginning we wanted to develop a robotic dog that improves your security at home by patrolling your house and alarming you. To scare off strangers, he should also be able to stand up and bark. 
We built the first prototype, which consisted of two wheels, two motors, a large plate. It was able to move around and bark at the colour red. You can see the prototype in the following picture.

We chose this idea, because we wanted to provide safety without putting a living being in danger. But while building we decided that we wanted to focus more on the social aspect of human-machine- interaction. That's why we switched our project goal: Our robotic dog should be able to interact with you and foster the relashionship by looking cute and approachable. *satz zum uncanny calley effect*

In the following we will guide you through the process of building and programming our robotic dog. We will also exlain why we choose the design and functions. 

## Installation & Prerequisites
1. Get the [LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime-Set](https://education.lego.com/de-de/products/lego-education-spike-prime-set/45678/) to build your roboter. 
2. Download the [LEGO® Education SPIKE™ App](https://education.lego.com/de-de/downloads/spike-app/software/) to your computer. Choose the right version for your operating system.   

## Bauanleitung
Our design was based on a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efhQDqzQOD4) that we found. After comparing different examples we choose this design, because it fitted our requirements the most: 
1. The design is quite realistic: It has dog-like features like ears or greeting you with a wagging tail. Because of the familiarity with the most typical features with a real dog the interaction threshold is lower compared to other designs. 
2. The positioning of the distance sensor and its look tries to imitate the eyes of a puppy. This works as a easy non-verbal communication tool.
3. The size of the robot is intentionally small, compact and robust. This makes it easy to carry the robot around and play with it.

In the following we will guide you through the building process:
