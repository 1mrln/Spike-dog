# Spike-dog
robotic dog with social functions made with Lego Spike
## What is this? 
We build a robotic dog with a focus on social interaction. It can move freely around the room and avoids obstacles. It also shows different reactions to different colors. When he sees yellow, he "greets" you by wagging his head and tail and barking happily. On magenta, it stops, barks and sounds the alarm. At the touch of a button, it starts the "heel" function, in which it moves at a defined distance from a person/object. 
In the following you can see a video with the functions and the code will be explained later.
